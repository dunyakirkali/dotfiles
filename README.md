# Dunya's Dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles.

This repo uses [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the dotfiles to my home directory.

If you want to use stow, clone this repository into `~/dotfiles` and do

## Usage

First install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)

Then stow the brewfile

```sh
TODO
```

And install all cags

```sh
brew bundle install
```

Then we will start stowing the bits and pieces we need

```sh
TODO
```
